# React APP using Redux and Typescript

## ‚ùî About

This project can be used as a boilerplate to another app,

The project is already setup with redux, it can be modified in any way.
It has already a ADD and REMOVE article used as example to illustrate the use of Redux.

There are two possible redux style implementation

- The first option is used for the Articles (src/store/article)
- The other one is used for the Posts (src/store/post)

I personally prefer the second one. But few free to implement the one that makes more sense for you and your team.
One thing that you might considerer is to use [Redux ducks pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux), it is for those who love to add all in one place, it just a matter of taste, you could also add [RTK](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) which makes everything much more fun.
